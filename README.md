# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-College-Majors-vs-Salary-

College degrees are very expensive. But, do they pay you back? Choosing Philosophy or International Relations as a major may have worried your parents, but does the data back up their fears? PayScale Inc. did a year-long survey of 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree. i'll be digging into this data using Pandas to answer these questions:

Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 

Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?

Which degrees have the highest earning potential?

What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?

Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?
